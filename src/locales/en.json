      "label": "From The Beginning",
      "description_1": "Atlas Plast traces its origins to 1975, when Engineer Abdul Amir Al-Moussawi began supplying foreign companies in Iraq’s booming construction sector. Despite the challenges of the 1990s, he founded Atlas Showroom in Baghdad’s Al-Shaab market, specializing in iron pipes and accessories. The showroom became a trusted distributor for the General Company for Trading Construction Materials and an important supplier for Baghdad Municipality projects.",
      "description_2": "The turning point came after 2003, when Atlas expanded under the name Atlas Plast, introducing international brands to Iraq and supplying major reconstruction projects. In 2004, a key partnership with Mr. Mahmoud Al-Jaf led to Masari Company securing the exclusive German Banninger agency, strengthening Atlas Plast’s reputation in the market.",
      "description_3": "During the difficult years of 2006–2007, the company relocated to Sulaymaniyah, managed by Engineer Jaafar Al-Moussawi, who partnered with Mr. Abdul Razzaq Al-Hayali to establish the Erbak Factory for PVC pipes. Despite its success, the factory closed in 2015 due to a lack of government support for local products."

      "description_2": "In 2012, the company founded Qimam Atlas Company to expand its international collaborations. Later, in 2018, Atlas Plast partnered with Spark Company to open a Vitra agency branch in Baghdad’s Camp Sarah market. That same year, it developed advanced storage facilities in Baghdad covering 20,000 m², featuring modern machinery, solar lighting, and fire protection systems.",
